# Guess the Word

Guess the Word is a web application that allows users to play a hangman-style guessing game.

## Project Description

This project is a fun and interactive Guess the Word game. The game starts with a word on the screen, with circle symbols acting as placeholders for each letter. Players start by entering a letter. If they guess correctly, the letter appears in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they learn how many guesses they have remaining. The player can also see which letters they’ve already guessed. The game lets the player know if they’ve already guessed a letter or entered a non-alphabetic character!

If the player guesses all the letters correctly before they use up their allotted guesses, they win! A Play Again button appears at the end of the game to prompt the player to give it another try! 

It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
